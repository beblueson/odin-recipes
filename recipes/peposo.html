        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Peposo is a traditional Tuscan Beef Stew originating from Florence. It truly is the simplest stew you'll ever make yet it has so much flavour. Made with garlic, lots of black pepper and a whole bottle of red wine, super delicious and perfect served with creamy polenta.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs beef chuck or shank or stewing beef (1 kg) cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 bottle red wine Chianti or Sangiovese if possible</li>
            <li>6 whole garlic cloves peeled</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt flakes or kosher salt</li>
            <li>11 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot, brown the beef on all sides for a minute or two (you might need to do this in batches so there is enough room).</li>
            <li>Add the beef and juices back to the pot (if browning in batches) and add the red wine, garlic, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a lid and simmer on a medium-low heat for 1.5 hours, uncover the pot and continue to simmer the stew for another 1.5 hours until the liquid has reduced slightly.</li>
            <li>STop tip: once the stew is uncovered check it every so often and give it a stir to make sure it doesn't stick or the meat at the top dries out.</il>
            <li>The beef should be tender but not completely falling apart. Serve with creamy polenta and crusty bread.</li>
        </ol>
